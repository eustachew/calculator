In the 10 cases I ran, 3 of them resulted in errors. 
The first error was with the input 10/((0-5)/(0-4)). It was expected to return 10: 
    It should have started doing the operation in the largest set of parentheses, which is (0-5)/(0-4). This should have returned 1.
    Then it should have done 10/1, and return 10. Instead it returned -2147483648. 
The second error was with the input (0-3)/((0-2)). It was expected to return 1. 
    It should have started doing the operation in the first set of parentheses, which is (0-3).
    Then it should have done ((0-2)), which is technically a valid operation, and finally do -3/-2, and return 1. Instead it returned -2147483648.
The third error was with the input 4/((1-3)/(0-1)). It was expected to return 2. 
    It should have started doing the operation in the largest set of parentheses, which is (1-3)/(0-1). This should have returned 2.
    Then it should have done 4/2, and return 2. Instead it returned -2147483648.

I think the bug is being caused by the use of parentheses inside of parentheses, because in all three of the bugs this was the common feature. 
I am not too sure why this would cause a bug, but everytime it returns the same value which makes me think the root cause is an issue with memory.
